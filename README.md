# Assignment 3 parallel_computing

`Script.rmd` represents the R notebook. The notebook describes parralel computing in importing molecular descriptors

One of the two datasets that has been used is a AHTS assay to identify small molecule activators of BRCA1 expression. It can be downloaded from PubChem Assay: [AID624202](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/624202), Download > Data Table only. The second dataset, which will be the descriptors dataset, can be generated from the AID 624202 dataset using [descriptors.Rmd](https://github.com/egonw/scientificProgramming/blob/master/assignment%202/descriptors.Rmd).

molecules will be converted into smiles and put back into the moleculs by the different cores
