### Clear working space
First step is to make sure that the working space is empty.
```{r}
# clear all variables

# set working directory
setwd("C:/Users/stijn/Desktop/Master systems biology/Systems biology year 2/scientific computing/parallelprocessing") 
```

### Load libraries
Loading the required packages for specific functions. 
```{r}

```

### Import data
load .sdf file (change working directory). import 5000 molecules (pb), initiate list,   
```{r}

```

### Parallel computing
distribute among cores. convert smiles, export to cores, parse smiles to molecules.
```{r}

```

### Plot
